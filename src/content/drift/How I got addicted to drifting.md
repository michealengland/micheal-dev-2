The year was 2019 when "Hyperdrive" was released on Netflix, and I had no clue that it would change my life after watching it. I decided to give it a try after running out of things to watch, and was immediately surprised. By the end of episode 1, I was hooked.

## The content creators that got me initially interested
What I loved the most about "Hyperdrive" wasn't the event courses, or people with insane budgets and unobtainable cars; it was people coming from all over the world that built their own car with what they had. Watching these drivers rip around these tracks with extreme precision, it was the first time I'd ever seen anything like it.
## Hi/Low reignited my love for the 350z
As always Netflix only made one season and I needed more in my life which is when Donut Media released the first season of "Hi/Low". As a person who has never done much beyond a few bolts ons for cars I was captivated with this series because they didn't just build another unobtainable car, instead they built an expensive and a cheap version of the 350z. This helped me get at least a rough idea of what is needed to actually make a drift car. Also, it's pretty entertaining.
## Watching a drift even for the first time
I can't tell you how many times I watched both of these shows, but it persuaded me to find a local drift event and attend. In the summer of 2021, I attended the "No Star Bash" event by Drift Indy. I made the mistake of attending on a Sunday which is more of a casual day and nothing too crazy. However, it gave me the opportunity to ask real drivers some questions. Most of them were super friendly and helpful in a lot of ways. A few of them didn't want to be bothered so I took the hint and moved on.

- What kind of cars are good for drifting?
- Which ones are reliable for beginners?
- What do I need to do to get started?
- How much do tires cost you?
- How long do tires last?

> One of the drivers even let me sit in their 350z and, and I was so excited that I didn't consider the fact that I'm too tall for his seat setup and got wedged between the seat and the dash. Everyone got a good laugh out of it, myself included.

After that day, the seed for wanting to build a drift car had been permanently planted; I already knew that I wanted a 350z and was sold even more after talking to drivers. In the years to come, I attended spectated more events at my local track and started thinking about how I could make this a reality.

If you're interested in learning, I can't recommend enough to just attend a local event and talk to drivers. Ask to go for a ride-along or just general questions about how they operate. Try to approach the guys that aren't in the middle of fixing cars and just ask them basic questions. A lot of them are on social and might be more than friendly to answer follow ups you may have later.

Another year goes by and I decided that I want to attend another event, I liked the first one so much that I wanted to see a real competition, not just a "free run day". This only fueled my desire to build a drift car even more. So I started thinking "what if I sold my car and used the extra cash to buy a car?" I think I could build one with help and advice from friends. My Uncle Lloyd is a pretty skilled mechanic and could give me pointers along the way (which he did many times). I had also talked to Joey again and he sent me a spreadsheet of his car build which greatly helped me get an idea of what to buy! A few weeks later I sold my car to Carmax and had a pretty good amount of cash to buy a car.

## How I chose the cars I wanted

Now that I knew I wanted a drift car I researched the hell out of them. I looked at BMWs, Miatas, a variety of Nissans, and even older Volvos. I looked at mustangs but decided I don't like them and didn't want one even though they are very well priced 🤷‍♂, sorry I'm just biased. Ultimately I decided some criteria that helped me narrow the search:
1. The car needs to be easy to modify and have a good community so that I can learn how to do things for the first time.
2. The car needs a good aftermarket parts support especially for drift specific parts. I don't have fabrication skills so bolt-ons are a big deal for me.
3. The car needed some cool factor and had to be something I enjoyed looking at.
4. Reliability is huge for me. I wanted a car that was built to take a beating. It didn't have to be fast. In fact, I preferred a lower power car because it meant spending less on tires.
5. The car had to be within a 10k budget or less. In fact the closer to 5k the better off I would be.

With all of these things in mind I eventually landed on the 350z. After a really long journey of messaging dudes on Facebook / instagram I eventually got a 350z. It was peak COVID prices and the cars were hard to find at reasonable prices. If one went up for sale, it wasn't around longer than a day or two. At that time period You'd see a clapped out 350z listed for 4-6k and good running high mileage ones around 8k. Then you'd see many listed at 10k or higher even if they were shit boxes. After not being able to land a few of the cars, I finally got to move on one like a lion killing a gazelle. It checked all the boxes of what I was looking for and the price seemed reasonable but not great.

My 350z came with some goodies:
- Clean chassis with little to no rust
- Full exhaust
- Nismo headers (not sure I consider this a bonus as the car isn't tuned and this causes my exhaust rasp to sound horrible)
- Plenum spacer
- Clean interior minus the drivers seat
- Had plenty of tire tread left
- CD009 Transmission (the ones that come in the 350z early years is notorious for having issues and this is the good one that is very reliable)
- Stage 3 clutch
- HID headlights
- Z1 metal under-shroud
- Engine seems to run good!
- Had the Z brembos already installed

Not so goodies:
- Had a leaking valve cover gasket and a broken vacuum line which made the car really hard accelerate in first gear without stalling
- The paint was pretty shitty and had extreme clear coat peel all over it
- Drivers side seat had a bolster that was flaking away and hurt your back after 20 minutes of driving
- Radio was dated and the speakers were pretty busted
- The OEM radio mounts were missing
- Someone installed a really jank harbor freight fog lights and they drilled a switch in the interior which didn't work
- The suspension had seen better days

After I bought it, It was such a proud moment and then I had to drive home having not driven a manual in over 10 years 😆. Ohhh yeah, I stalled it a few times.
## My journey had begun
After I got back from vacation I immediately wanted to attend the next No Star Bash local drift even and do some ride-alongs and get ideas about how to do the build. I already had a parts list and even started moving on some of the basics such as new seats. I picked things based on quality of life improvements.

At No Star Bash 2022, I got to do ride along in my friend Taylors 240sx and his cousin Ian's 350z. The ride-alongs were the most awesome thing I got to experience in a car. I had so much fun that when I got out of the car my first thought was "I need to buy parts and get into this now!".

While I was No Star Bash, I got great advice on what not do to and what kind of tools you need to bring and things to be prepared for. I can't thank those guys enough for helping a no-nothing dude like myself learn and go out there.
