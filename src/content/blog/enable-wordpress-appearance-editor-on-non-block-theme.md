This title might be a bit misleading because, as of now, thereâ€™s no straightforward way to force the appearance panel without an index.html according to the WordPress source code. If you're building a hybrid theme or transitioning from `.php` to `.html` templates, you may have encountered this issue where you want to use the appearance editor but arenâ€™t ready to fully adopt the `.html` template system.

Youâ€™re not alone. This has been an [open issue](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39931) for over two years, and no solution has been officially accepted. This can be frustrating, as it presents a significant barrier to embracing the block editor. In some cases, using an `index.html` template overrides the PHP counterpart, which may not be ideal without careful planning or extensive work in converting to the HTML theme template system.

## Ways to Enable the Appearance Editor

You can enable the appearance editor by creating an `index.html` file in one of two locations:

1. `templates/index.html`
2. `block-templates/index.html`

Thatâ€™s it. Based on the source code, there are no other ways to achieve this.

- [is_block_theme()](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/class-wp-theme.php#L1577-L1597) - Specifically checks for `index.html`.
- [site-editor.php](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/49ed36d7173058f25fb429a53d357902d8da9e91/wp-admin/site-editor.php#L29-L35) - Uses `is_block_theme()` to prevent access to `site-editor.php` if the criteria is not met.

## How to Move Forward

There are a few ways to move forward, but each comes with trade-offs ðŸ˜…. Sorry, but thatâ€™s just how it is.

### Option 1: Converting Your Site to Blocks

Unfortunately, this is the best long-term solution. It requires the most work, but if you convert your site to the new HTML system, you can fully utilize the appearance editor. However, itâ€™s a significant time investment for custom sites, as you may need to recreate many templates as blocks to make this viable.

**Pros:**
- Full access to the appearance editor.

**Cons:**
- High time and resource investment.

### Option 2: Rendering a Template with a PHP Server-Side Block

You can try using `index.html` along with a custom server-side block to render what your original template would have displayed. In my case, this approach caused some issues with scripts rendering incorrectly, but itâ€™s worth trying since itâ€™s relatively simple and doesnâ€™t require a large time commitment.

**Steps:**

1. Create a barebones block for use in a pattern or template.
2. Use a PHP render in the `save` method to output the PHP code you'd normally render.
3. Use the block within an `.html` template.

**WARNING:**
This option had some side effects for me. Although the template rendered correctly on the frontend, some header scripts behaved unexpectedly.

**Pros:**
- Full access to the appearance editor.
- Low time investment.
- Allows the use of `index.html`.

**Cons:**
- May cause unintended side effects.
- Feels like a workaround rather than a true solution ðŸ˜….

### Option 3: Avoid Using `index.html` Altogether

Through trial and error, I considered not using `index.html` at all. However, I still wanted to use patterns and templates within the block editor. Initially, I struggled to find a way to manage patterns without the appearance editor, as there was little documentation on this. Hereâ€™s what I learned:

#### Managing Patterns Without `index.html`

Since we canâ€™t edit patterns via the appearance editor, we must do things a little differently. WordPress offers a custom post type for patterns under `wp_block`. This lists all patterns saved on your site. Hereâ€™s how to access it:

- Go to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block` while logged in.
- Alternatively, access the "Manage Patterns" link within the block editor:
  - Options > Tools > Manage Patterns.
  - On a synced block, Options > Manage Patterns (not available on non-synced blocks).

**Pros:**
- You can add, edit, and delete patterns.
- No need for `index.html`, so your PHP templates work as expected.
- Theme-registered patterns are still accessible ðŸ˜„.
- You can delay converting to `.html` templates.

**Cons:**
- Custom patterns registered in `/patterns/your-pattern.php` wonâ€™t automatically appear in the appearance editor.
- Accessing and managing patterns is not intuitive and hard to find for most users.

## Accessing the `wp_block` Post Type

1. Go to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block` while logged in.
2. Create custom patterns via the block editor. (Note: The "Manage Patterns" button only appears if you create a synced block.)
3. You can view all patterns on the block editor page, though thereâ€™s no "Manage Patterns" link here.
4. Under the options menu, find the "Manage Patterns" button in the tools section.

## Summary

I hope this information saves others some time. I found limited resources while troubleshooting my specific use case, and maybe I wasnâ€™t searching for the right answers, or perhaps itâ€™s just not widely known. Either way, I spent more time troubleshooting the platform than actually solving problems.
