In my professional journey, there came a moment when I shifted my focus from proficiency in coding to prioritizing workflow efficiency. This change in perspective led me to closely examine how I spent my time on routine tasks, such as pulling down code, reviewing and drafting pull requests (PRs). I soon realized that these tasks, while minor, consumed a significant portion of my day. This change in thought steered me towards exploring solutions that could streamline these processes and enhance productivity.
