At a certain point in my career, I started focusing on efficiency rather than just being proficient at coding. My aim shifted to identifying and solving issues quickly and effectively. Upon evaluating the fragments of time lost during a typical day to routine tasks—like pulling down code, reviewing PRs (pull requests), and drafting them—I realized that these seemingly small intervals cumulatively accounted for a significant portion of my day.

- Learning the ropes is quite straightforward; you don't need to invest hundreds of hours. Start with the basics and gradually build up your expertise.
- The rewards are immediate. You can integrate new techniques into your workflow right away and notice the difference.
- Tailoring CLI (Command Line Interface) commands to fit within both your professional and personal workflow is entirely feasible.
- It’s a means to free up a considerable amount of time that could be better spent elsewhere. Engaging with GitHub is often a natural aspect of being a developer or playing a role within a repository.

## Who could benefit from learning the GitHub CLI?
Honestly, the GitHub CLI can be invaluable for many types of roles. Essentially, if you're interacting with a repository in any capacity, you have a good reason to explore this tool. Here are some roles that I've observed benefit from it:

- Developers
- Team Leads
- QA team members
- Product Owners
- Anyone that needs to interact with GitHub

## Why should you bother learning the GitHub CLI?
Before diving in, I want to emphasize how much I appreciate this intuitive and user-friendly CLI tool. I've found it so useful and impressive that I was compelled to write this guide, hoping others will share my enthusiasm.
