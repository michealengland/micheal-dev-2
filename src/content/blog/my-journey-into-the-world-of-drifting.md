**The year was 2019 when "Hyperdrive" was released on Netflix, and little did I know that watching it would change my life.** I decided to give it a try after running out of things to watch, and I was immediately hooked within the first few episodes. In typical Netflix fashion, only one season was made despite promises of a second. Spoilers: it never came.

## The Content Creators That Initially Caught My Interest
What I loved the most about "Hyperdrive" wasn't the event courses, or people with insane budgets and unobtainable cars; it was people coming from all over the world that built their own car with what they had. Watching these drivers rip around these tracks with extreme precision, it was the first time I'd ever seen anything like it.

## Hi/Low Reignited My Love for the 350z
With only one season of "Hyperdrive" available, I craved more, and that's when I discovered Donut Media's "Hi/Low". As someone who had only done basic modifications to cars, this series was fascinating. They didn't just build another unattainable car; they built both an expensive and a budget-friendly version of the 350z. This show not only entertained but also provided a rough guide on what it takes to build a drift car.

## Watching a Drift Event for the First Time
I can't recall how many times I rewatched these shows, but they inspired me to check out a local drift event. In the summer of 2021, I attended "No Star Bash" by Drift Indy. I chose a Sunday, which turned out to be a more casual day, but it was perfect for asking drivers questions. Most were incredibly friendly and helpful, sharing insights on:

- Suitable cars for drifting
- Reliable options for beginners
- Steps to get started
- Tire costs and longevity

> One of the drivers even let me sit in their 350z, I was so excited that I didn't consider the fact that I'm too tall for his seat setup and got wedged between the seat and the dash. Everyone got a good laugh out of it, myself included.

After that day, the seed for wanting to build a drift car had been permanently planted; I already knew that I wanted a 350z and was sold even more after talking to drivers. In the years to come, I attended spectated more events at my local track and started thinking about how I could make this a reality.

If you're interested in learning, I can't recommend enough to just attend a local event and talk to drivers. Ask to go for a ride-along or just general questions about how they operate. Try to approach the guys that aren't in the middle of fixing cars and just ask them basic questions. A lot of them are on social and might be more than friendly to answer follow ups you may have later.
