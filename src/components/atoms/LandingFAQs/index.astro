		<dd>Worked on some big projects in 2024-25, but super proud of Stellar Pages! 🚀 Started as an Electron app, now a web app for converting Markdown to stylish PDFs. One of the coolest parts? A custom page splitter that smartly breaks docs into pages. 📄✨</p>

		<dt>How have you maintained productivity during remote work?</dt>
		<dd>Always refining my workflow! 🚀 This past year, I’ve leveled up with: Neovim + tmux for focus 🎯, LLMs for efficiency 🤖, deeper DS & algorithms study 📚, and PARA for meticulous notes 📝.</dd>

		<dt>What are some ways that you have ensured that a codebase is well-structured and maintainable?</dt>
		<dd>Keeping code maintainable is all about structure! 🛠️ My go-to rules: modular files 📁, consistent standards 📏, clear comments 📝, focused functions 🎯, static typing ✅, and smart testing over 100% coverage 🧪.</p>

		<dt>How do you keep up-to-date with technological advancements in your field?</dt>
		<dd>I stay sharp by mixing hands-on work with self-learning! 🚀 Online courses, docs, and lots of experimenting 🔬. I love understanding the why, not just the how. Mini projects + structured notes help it all stick! 📝💡</dd>
