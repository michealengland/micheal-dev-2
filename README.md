# Welcome to My Personal Playground! ðŸŽ‰

Hey there! I'm Mike, a passionate developer with a love for creating and experimenting with web technologies. This is my personal site, a space where I blend my enthusiasm for JavaScript, TypeScript, and design to build cool stuff. This site is intended to be easy to maintain and update with the power of markdown. ðŸš€

This site was previously migrated from my first personal site, [micheal.dev](https://micheal.dev), which was built with Gatsby.

## What's Under the Hood?

- **Astro.js**: The stellar framework that makes building fast, optimized websites a breeze.
- **Markdown**: Keeping it simple and readable with Markdown for content creation.
- **TypeScript**: Adding that extra layer of type safety to my JavaScript adventures.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Crafting beautiful, responsive designs without breaking a sweat.
- **Jest**: Ensuring everything works flawlessly with robust testing.

## Why This Stack?

I chose this stack because it strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power. Astro.js and Markdown let me focus on content, while TypeScript and Tailwind ensure my code is maintainable and stylish. And with Jest, I can sleep soundly knowing my tests have got my back.

Feel free to clone this and make it your own.

Happy coding! âœ¨

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
